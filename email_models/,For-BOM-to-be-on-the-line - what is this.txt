The message files in TXT must be encoded in UTF-8 with BOM so that email programs that need it, know how to decode the
text (even with the BOM not being needed supposedly, as said by Unicode - UTF-8 doesn't need BOM, officially, but there
are people who use it to find out the encoding of the text, so use it always). This happens with Gmail Notifier Pro, for
example, in which if the file is encoded in UTF-8 without BOM, it assumes it's CP1252, BUT only outside the body of the
message - in the notifications and in the subject, not in the HTML (I found this out by chance).

If the "For-BOM-to-be: on-the-line" isn't there, the 3 characters that are before From: (0xEF 0xBB 0xBF --> the BOM
marker bytes) will make it be recognized as another word that doesn't exist, since these 3 characters are not printable.
So anything can be put there, since it's there for nothing and it doesn't make any difference because it's going to be
ignored (no email reader is going to use what I wrote for anything), so I decided to put that there.
