# V.I.S.O.R. - Email Sender
Email Sender module of V.I.S.O.R.

This repository is a submodule on the [V.I.S.O.R. - Server Version Assistant](https://github.com/Edw590/VISOR---Server-Version-Assistant) project (the main project).

## What it does
This module sends the emails that are queued for it to send.

It works with cURL (the curl command), so it must be installed on the system and be on the PATH. It also works by sending an EML file containing the raw email information.
